# Setting Up EKS

## Overview

After a lot of research, the advice that resonated with me the most was to use EKSCTL to create an EKS cluster and not manage it through Terraform or CloudFront. The best write-up I found to explain why is [here](https://www.devops-nirvana.com/creating-a-kubernetes-cluster-on-aws-with-eksctl/).
