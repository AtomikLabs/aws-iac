I want to model AI and computer science and build tools that augment anyone who wants to understand, build, or research in the field.

It started as a project to help me stay current as I move through grad school. Now AtomikLabs supports about ~800 subscribers to daily TechcraftingAI research summary newsletters and TTS podcasts.

## Current Status

I am building the data pipeline and populating the graph database that will support all future development. The next major step is a research news site that will host the podcasts, showcase the latest research, and allow users to sign up for customized research newsletters.

## Thanks to arXiv and Cornell University

None of this would be possible without [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/). It's easy to take that resource for granted, but the contribution it makes to open science is immeasurable.
